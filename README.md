# DesignPatterns

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ThomasSchuetz/DesignPatterns.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ThomasSchuetz/DesignPatterns)

## Objective

This repository presents an overview of different [design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern#Classification_and_list).


## Structure

Every design pattern considered in this repository is explained in a separate folder. Additionally a short example is presented and reference implementations (preferably in Python) are provided.

## Further benefits for me

This repository also demonstrates the usage of Travis-CI, a test-driven development approach and a gitflow branching model.
